# Documentation Structure Workflow

When a developer finishes implementing a significant feature or architectural change, this workflow defines how to document the system in a structured, maintainable, and consistent way.

## Guidelines

1. **Location**: Documentation for a specific feature or domain should be placed in `docs/<feature-name>/`.
2. **Format**: All documentation must be written in Markdown. Use tables and code blocks for readability.
3. **Template**: The documentation should follow the modular structure implemented in `docs/auth/`. Breakdown the knowledge into domain-specific files rather than one giant README.

---

## Expected File Structure

When creating documentation for a feature, aim to split the information into these core files within your `docs/<feature-name>/` directory:

### 1. `README.md`
- **Purpose**: High-level overview, table of contents, and a quick start guide.
- **Expected Content**:
  - **Overview**: A brief summary of what the feature is and its primary objective.
  - **Table of Contents**: Markdown links to the other files in the folder (e.g., `[Frontend Guide](./frontend.md)`).
  - **Quick Start**: Step-by-step instructions on how to set up, run, and test the feature.
  - **Tech Stack**: A table listing the technologies used across the stack for this feature.

### 2. `architecture.md`
- **Purpose**: System design, flow, and justification of technical choices.
- **Expected Content**:
  - **Flow Diagrams**: ASCII art or structural block representations showing how data moves between frontend, backend, and external services.
  - **Key Design Decisions**: Document the *why* behind architectural choices (e.g., "Why we chose a frontend-driven approach" or "Why we used Context instead of Redux").
  - **Security Model/Boundaries**: Explain how data is protected in this specific feature.

### 3. `frontend.md`
- **Purpose**: Client-side implementation and usage details.
- **Expected Content**:
  - **File Structure**: A tree representation of only the files relevant to this feature in `frontend/src/`.
  - **Core Concepts**: Explanations of key Contexts, Providers, or global states used.
  - **Important Components**: Documentation of major UI components or views.
  - **API Integration**: Explanation of how the client requests data from the backend (Axios, interceptors, etc.).
  - **Usage Examples**: Code snippets showing how to consume the feature in other parts of the app.

### 4. `backend.md` (If applicable)
- **Purpose**: Server-side mechanics, endpoints, and database interactions.
- **Expected Content**:
  - **File Structure**: A tree representation of only the files relevant to this feature in `backend/src/`.
  - **Models/Schema**: Markdown tables representing database schemas, required fields, and relationships.
  - **Middlewares & Logic**: Explanation of any custom middleware or complex service logic.
  - **Routing**: Examples of how the endpoints are registered and how they are protected.

### 5. `environment.md` (If applicable)
- **Purpose**: Centralized reference for all configuration requirements.
- **Expected Content**:
  - **Config Tables**: Separate tables for Frontend and Backend variables including `Variable Name`, `Required (Yes/No)`, `Description`, and `Example`.
  - **Sourcing Instructions**: Step-by-step guides on where to find third-party API keys or connection strings.
  - **Security Reminders**: Warnings about which keys must remain private and safe handling practices.

## Steps to Execute This Workflow

1. Look through the completed changes to understand the full scope of the feature.
2. Create the `docs/<feature-name>/` directory if it does not already exist.
3. Start with the `README.md` to establish the summary and outline.
4. Write `architecture.md` to cover flow diagrams and outline key design decisions.
5. Write `frontend.md` and `backend.md` as necessary to explain directory structures, data models, state management, and routing.
6. If any new `.env` variables were added, document their purpose, examples, and security considerations thoroughly in `environment.md`.
